refactor(rabbit): clean up .gitignore and add description file

- Remove unnecessary entries from the main .gitignore file, including generated files and duplicate entries.
- Delete the app/rabbit/.gitignore file as it was redundant.
- Introduce a new description.txt file in the app/rabbit directory to provide context for the feature related to the time engine.

These changes streamline the project's ignore settings and improve documentation clarity.
