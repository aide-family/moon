# Background

Moon is a monitoring and alerting platform designed for modern technology stacks, providing comprehensive monitoring solutions for cloud-native, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. With the rapid development of technology, traditional monitoring tools can no longer meet diverse needs. Moon was created to simplify monitoring operations and enhance system reliability and observability.

Moon's design philosophy is "Simple, Smart, and Efficient." Through real-time data monitoring, intelligent alerts, and fault response, Moon helps enterprises and developers quickly identify and resolve issues, ensuring system stability.

# Core Features

* **Cloud-Native Monitoring**: Supports monitoring for Kubernetes, Docker, and other cloud-native technologies, providing multi-dimensional metrics for clusters, nodes, and Pods.

* **IoT Support**: Designed for IoT devices, it supports large-scale device connectivity and real-time data collection, offering device status monitoring and anomaly alerts.

* **AI Integration**: Built-in AI algorithms support anomaly detection, trend prediction, and other intelligent analysis functions, helping users identify potential issues in advance.

* **Real-Time Data Monitoring**: Provides real-time data stream monitoring, supports multiple data sources, and ensures real-time and accurate data.

* **Intelligent Alert System**: Rule-based alerting mechanism supports multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, Slack, etc.) and provides alert prioritization and automated fault response.

* **Visual Dashboards**: Offers rich visualization components, allowing users to customize dashboards and view system status and monitoring data in real time.

* **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Supports multi-tenant architecture, enabling different teams or projects to use the monitoring platform independently while ensuring data isolation and security.

# Vision

Moon's vision is to become a globally leading multi-domain monitoring and alerting platform, helping enterprises and developers achieve efficient operations in complex system environments. We hope that through Moon, users can easily address monitoring challenges in cloud-native, IoT, and AI technologies, improving system stability and observability.

We believe that future monitoring tools will not only collect and display data but also serve as intelligent operation assistants. Moon will continue to innovate, integrating AI and big data technologies to provide users with smarter and more efficient monitoring solutions.
